# projectIdea

## Overview 

Plan to make a webapp that gives you a project idea with the chance to pick up a new project at random.
Once selected it gives the chance to add a repo to the project. 

## Requirements

### v1
*This version of the model will have no users, just a random project title generator.*
*The focus here is building and call databases with an API. The model will have no front end, just methods of adding, removing and linking data.*

- Create the databases for projects.
- Add, Update, Remove and randomly call a project from the database.
- Add base levels of metrics that can be called via the API
- ~~add endpoint for API status check.~~ 

### v2
*Adding tags to the projects*

- Create a tag db and call it
- Connect the databases together using keys so a project can have tags 

### v3
*Initialise the front end side of things. HTML only so very simple but now a webpage.*
*This is all still locally hosted so no networks. No styling yet so black text on white background.* 

### v4 
*UX side of things now, still incredibly simple.*
- Random button to find a new project idea.
- CSS styling to make model look good.
- Potential add dark mode here (with toggle)

### v5
*Further UX enhancements* 
- Go forwards/backwards if there is a previously loaded project 
- Make the model look much better 
- Hover over a card with description 
- Potential to have basic functionality and some advanced ideas 

### Potential Future enhancements. 
*Project can be seen as being completed here. Potential future enhancements to make the project much wider in scope.* 
- Adding users - can flag that projects are completed and add github url etc. 
- Abillity to add projects for others to pick up. 
- Start with just random adding projects. 
- Can move to setting up seperate users that add with aim to benefit at the end (charity element). 
- End dates for projects.
